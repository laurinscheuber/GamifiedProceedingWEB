                    <h2>Enjoy the lively tussle at ti&m's lake Zurich event 'Shake the Lake'. Sailing? Wakeboarding? We've got it all, book your timeslot with the Shake the Lake app now.</h2>
                    <h3>Initial Situation/Problem statement</h3>
                    <p>
						The "Shake the Lake" summer event hosted by ti&m, is the once a year event that draws numerous attendees eager to enjoy boat rides and lakeside activities. 
						Unfortunately, the current organizational setup heavily relies on manual processes, creating significant inefficiencies.
					</p>
					<p>
						Customer information, including credentials, is collected at an information hut and written down by hand, resulting in long wait times and potential errors in data handling. 
						Changes to boat schedules are also challenging to manage.
						Without a centralized system, rescheduling or notifying impacted customers about schedule changes is inefficient and oftentimes almost impossible to do, 
						leading to confusion and dissatisfaction. 
						Overall, the reliance on pen-and-paper processes creates an administrative overhead that detracts from the overall event experience for both attendees and organizers.
					</p>
                    <h3>Project Goal</h3>
                    <p>
						The aim is to achieve an Shake the Lake event experience that is uncomplicated and simple for attendees and the organisation committee. 
						Achieving this goal will be done with a mobile app for attendees and a web application for the organization committee.
					</p>
					<p>
						Attendees will benefit from a user-friendly mobile app that simplifies the booking process, 
						enabling them to easily select their preferred boat rides and activities. 
						The app will also send timely reminders and updates, ensuring they are informed about their schedules and any changes.
					</p>
					<p>
						The organisation committee will have access to a web app designed to optimize administrative planning. 
						This platform will allow organizers to send custom notifications to attendees, 
						assist with manual booking entries for customers without access to the mobile app, 
						and monitor bookings and reschedule timeslots efficiently. 
						By centralizing and automating key processes, the system will significantly reduce manual overhead 
						while enhancing the overall experience for both attendees and organizers.
