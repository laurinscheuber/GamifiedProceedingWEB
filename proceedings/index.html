                    <h3>Initial Situation/Problem statement</h3>
                    <p>The University for music of FHNW in Basel held an event called <strong>"SPIEL! games as critical
                            practice"</strong> in January of 2023. The 4 day event held many different performances like
                        lectures, concerts, vernissages and discussions. The Event was a highlight for the University
                        and there was a lot of educational content created at the event. These proceedings were in the
                        hand of a few people and the broader public didn't have a way to access it.</p>
                    <h3>Project Goal</h3>
                    <p>Our goal was to create a <strong>web based archive</strong> to provide all the content from the
                        event <strong>SPIEL! games as critical practice</strong>, in one public place. The second
                        objective was to build a gamified way to showcase the <strong>connection between the
                            proceedings</strong> from the event. The client had no specific way for the representation
                        of the interconnectivity in mind, so we had to become creative.</p>

                    <blockquote><strong>Testemonial</strong><br>
                        «I experienced the collaboration with the team of students and their coach as very dynamic,
                        innovative and mutually
                        beneficial. The almost one-year development period is worthwhile: in close collaboration, new
                        ideas and possibilities
                        also arise for the client - in my case, the project has helped me not only to publish my
                        research data, but also to
                        structure it sustainably. The students already have their own professional experience and the
                        mix of the team brings
                        together different fields of expertise, technology, data management and design, which has led to
                        a well-rounded and
                        refined end product.»<br>
