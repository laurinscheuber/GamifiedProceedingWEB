							The Contact Lens Catalogue 2.0 transforms how
							optometrists access and manage information about
							lenses and care products. This powerful platform
							streamlines the search process, offering a
							comprehensive, up-to-date catalog in multiple
							languages. With advanced filtering, seamless data
							management, and user-friendly features, the tool
							simplifies the day-to-day operations of optometry
							professionals, making it easier than ever to find
							the right products and manage customer data.
						</h2>

						<h3>Initial Situation/Problem Statement</h3>
						<p>
							The Contact Lens Catalogue (CLC) 1.0 was developed
							as a web-based resource aimed at optometry students.
							While it contains comprehensive technical
							information about contact lenses and care products,
							the current version is limited to internal use by
							students and is not suitable for public deployment.
							Major functionalities such as master data
							management, product updates, and customer management
							are either missing or inadequately developed, making
							it immature for broader use in the Swiss market.
						</p>

						<h3>Project Goal</h3>
						<p>
							The primary objective of the Contact Lens Catalogue
							(CLC) 2.0 project is to develop a robust,
							user-friendly platform that serves as the central
							reference for optometrists in Switzerland. The
							updated catalogue will provide:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								An exhaustive, up-to-date, and independent
								source of information on contact lenses and care
								products available in Switzerland.
							</li>
							<li>
								Comprehensive features to manage master data and
								streamline product updates, including
								semi-automated updates for disposable lenses.
							</li>
							<li>
								Support for advanced user management, enabling
								both student users and external paying
								subscribers to access and personalize their
								experience.
							</li>
							<li>
								Enhanced search and filtering capabilities,
								along with options to save search results and
								tailor user profiles.
							</li>
							<li>
								Accessibility across multiple devices, including
								mobile and tablet platforms, ensuring ease of
								use for all users.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							By achieving these goals, the platform aims to
							become an indispensable tool for optometrists,
							enhancing efficiency and accuracy in their daily
							operations while maintaining a high standard of
							independence and reliability.

						<h3>Developed Solution and its Benefit</h3>
						<p>
							The development of the Contact Lens Catalogue 2.0
							began from scratch, as the previous version had
							significant legacy issues and could not meet the
							fundamentally changed customer requirements. By
							starting fresh, we ensured the new system would be
							robust, modern, and scalable to address current and
							future needs.
						</p>
						<ul class="nobullet">
							<li>
								<strong>Automatic parser foundation:</strong>
								Considerable effort went into developing an
								automatic parser to gather lens product data
								from manufacturers. However, the parser could
								not be completed due to a lack of standardized
								data formats.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Clean database migration:</strong> The
								client’s Excel data was successfully transformed
								into a well-structured SQLite database, ensuring
								easier data management and improved reliability.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Robust API development:</strong> A
								well-documented and scalable API was developed,
								providing a strong foundation for further
								feature expansion and integrations.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>FHNW branding:</strong> The platform now
								incorporates FHNW's official styling, ensuring
								consistency with institutional branding and
								enhancing professionalism.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Modern implementation:</strong> The
								existing features from the previous project were
								redeveloped using Java Spring Boot and Nuxt.js,
								creating a maintainable solution that is ready
								for handover to an IT firm.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Integrated data management:</strong> The
								client can now manage their data directly within
								the tool, eliminating the need for manual Excel
								imports.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							By reworking the application and addressing the
							challenges of the previous version, the Contact Lens
							Catalogue 2.0 is now in a position to be further
							developed and scaled. The transition to modern
							frameworks and clean code ensures the platform is
							ready for future enhancements and professional
							deployment.
						</p>
						<p>
							The new implementation not only provides immediate
							benefits to the client but also establishes a robust
							infrastructure for long-term growth and
							sustainability.
