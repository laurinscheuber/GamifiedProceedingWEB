                <h1>Tour Booking</h1>
                <h2>Experience the historic charm of Niederwald and learn about the life and legacy of world-renowned
                    hotelier Cäsar Ritz. Book your guided tour digitally and dive into a journey through time.</h2>
                <h3>Initial Situation/Problem statement</h3>
                <p>The Niederwald Visitor Center was established in 2017, transforming the former Niederwald train
                    station into a tribute to Cäsar Ritz with a permanent exhibition. Additional offerings include a
                    village tour, a themed walking trail (to be redesigned in 2025), periodic events, and a breakfast
                    salon in the station’s bistro.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, organizing tours for guests remains challenging. Requests (for tours with or without a
                    village walk, in languages such as German, English, French, and Italian) often come by phone or
                    email, leading to numerous follow-ups to clarify details like date, time, group size, and type.
                    Finding available and suitable guides is time-intensive, and all guide arrangements and
                    confirmations are done manually. Feedback collection and invoicing are also manual, leading to
                    inefficiencies and potential errors.</p>
                <h3>Project Goal</h3>
                <p>The goal is to streamline this process with a web application that simplifies requests, making them
                    more transparent and efficient for guests. This platform will ease administrative tasks by
                    automating the guide selection process, invoicing, and feedback collection, reducing the need for
                    manual correspondence. Guides will also benefit from receiving relevant information in a
                    standardized format, enhancing their engagement.</p>

                    This solution simplifies guest interactions and enhances administrative efficiency, benefiting both
                    visitors and guides.
